# Loco SDK for PHP

## Installation

Installation is via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#using-composer).

Add the latest stable version of [loco/loco](https://packagist.org/packages/loco/loco) to your project's composer.json file as follows:

    "require": {
        "loco/loco": "~1.0"
    }


If you want to install straight from Github you'll have to write your own [autoloader](https://gist.github.com/jwage/221634) for now.


## REST API Client

This SDK includes a REST client for the [Loco API](https://localise.biz/api). Other utilities will be added in future.

The converter API for language pack file formats can be used without a Loco account. Other endpoints are for working with Loco projects and require an API key.

See [localise.biz/api](https://localise.biz/api) for full API documention.


### Usage

See examples directory.

Proper docs coming soon.
